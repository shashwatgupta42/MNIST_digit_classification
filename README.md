# MNIST Digit Classification
In this project, I have used my own feed forward neural net framework (that I wrote in this project- https://github.com/shashwatgupta42/neural_net) for MNIST digit classification, which is a multiclass classification problem. The task is to classify 28*28 greyscale images of handwritten digits. 

Content-
- MNIST_Classification.ipynb - The main jupyter notebook
- Binary_Classification.ipynb - Binary classification of only 0 and 1 images (without the previously written Neural Net class) that I wrote just as an exercise.
- mnist_model.dat - Binary file containing the trained model (see the end of MNIST_Classification.ipynb for detail)
